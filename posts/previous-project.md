# | University Projects
In univeresity, we started having projects in Year 2, ranging from:
- Mobile Applications
- System Analysis
- Web Development

Of all the projects, I am most proud of working with was **FoodForUs** - our Google Solutions 2020 
submission. 

# | FoodForUs
With Google Solutions being centered around solving community issues, **FoodForUs** is a 
community-based mobile application that deals with food waste issues in Penang. The idea of it 
is to donate extra food to the needy by any civilian.

The mobile application was built using **Android Studio**, Java and Google Services.

# | Challenges
### 1. Lack of experience
Prior to this, we had only one mobile application development experience. We decided to keep the 
momentum going by joining this competition. However, due to the lack of experience, the project 
was not smooth. Some other factors include:
1. We have not learnt about Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
2. We did not have a supervisor to guide us.
3. Lack of knowledge about Android Studio.

### 2. Scope Creep
Due to the fact that we have not learnt about SDLC, there were a lot of scope creeps and the 
requirements were not very clear from the beginning. Since we came up the idea ourselves, 
the functionalities often became more instead of the opposite.

# | Solution
### 1. Being Resourceful
USM School of Computer Science has instilled this value in us since the beginning. For every project, 
we had to be resourceful - read and learn the languages ourselves, implementing new technologies 
into our projects.

Hence, it did not faze us that we were not experienced. We just had to work harder.

### 2. Teamwork
Most of us, in the team, are in the same boat. Thus, we had to work as a team and support each other 
throughout the whole process. Since some of us are focusing on different aspects, we taught 
each other the mechanisms if we understood it more.

### 3. Time Management
Because we joined this competition on our own accord, we had to manage our time wisely in order to 
prevent us neglecting our schoolwork as well.

# | Lessons Learnt
There are 3 aspects on what I learnt through this experience:
### 1. Technology and Values
I definitely would say that I learnt more about technology - Git, Firebase, Android Studio, etc- after 
working on this project. Not only that, but also the ***values*** we need to have in learning new things.

Being tenacious, having grit, being resourceful and also a good mindset is required when learning about 
developing new applications.

### 2. Development Process
At the end of the competition, I reflected on what should be done instead so that the whole process would 
be much smoother. For example, doing proper planning and requirements documentation beforehand.

This further solidifies that each step in the SDLC has its own purpose and a reason. Not only that, 
every member plays an equally important role when trying to make something happen.

### 3. Process Matters
Even though we did not win, but throughout the journey, I learnt a lot from it. All the accumulated 
experience will improve on how I grow as a developer.
