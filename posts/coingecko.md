# | Previous Work Experiences
![Working Timeline](/job-timeline.png)

Looking back at my previous job experiences, I reflected on why I applied for those jobs.  
The reasons are mainly:
### 1. Exposure
Before enrolling into university, I wanted to experience different working fields. Hence, why I started off with exhibitions. Then moving to office work like marketing. After I decided to study Computer Science, I applied to SELLBYTEL, where I was trained in computer hardware knowledge.

### 2. Supportive Space
Most jobs I have done them with my friends. I realized a healthy support network is crucial when the going gets tough. For example during my work in Big Bad Wolf, we had to endure the 7pm -7am shift. Without strong and equal-minded people around, the journey would have been much tougher.

Same goes to my other jobs. The people there were very encouraging even though I was lacking in terms of experience.

# | Why CoinGecko?
I started off with the above is because I feel CoinGecko has those qualities.
### 1. Various Technologies
Looking through CoinGecko's website, CoinGecko has developed numerous applications of different platforms: APIs, websites, mobile applications and widgets. As mentioned above, I would love to be exposed to the development of those kind of applications! From planning to maintaining them.

At this point of my studies, I think it is crucial to have hands-on experience with as many types of applications as possible. CoinGecko can definitely offer some valuable learning experiences.
### 2. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
As stated in the job post, having some knowledge and know-hows about blockchain would be useful in the future; blockchain is only getting more widely used through the years. Also, one of the 
reasons why USM has their internship in Year 3 is to let us discover the practices in the industry. 
Hence, allowing us to use them for our FYP.

Not only that, I have no solid knowledge about cryptocurrency, albeit popular nowadays. It 
can surely broaden my horizons if I interned at CoinGecko. (and finally make sense of crypto)
### 3. Company Achievements
CoinGecko has made quite the name for itself after operating for only 6 years. With all research 
collaborations, media coverage, and also bulding the world's largest cryptocurrency data platform, 
this would have been impossible if without a good company vision and a good team. (both which I value)

# | Summary
With all that being said, I hope that I am a character that fits into the company's culture as well 
as work ethic.
